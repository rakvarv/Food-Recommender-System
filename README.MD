# Recommender System

## Description:
This project is a food recommendation system research project, where we made two different recommendation syststems. First is a Knowledge-Based recommendation system, the second is a Hybrid Content-Based recommendation system. These systems are A/B tested against each other to evaluate satisfaction, ease of use, and understanding. Results are stored in a CSV file which is accessible in the project files.
